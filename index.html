        <p>
          Hi, I'm Jarne, a 17-year-old guy passionate about web development. I'm
          from Belgium and currently learning the ropes of creating awesome
          websites. I have a particular interest in front-end development and
          enjoy crafting engaging user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides web development, I also have some experience in Python
          programming. I've tinkered with Python to build small projects and
          automate tasks. I find it fascinating how coding empowers us to bring
          ideas to life and solve problems in creative ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited to continue my journey in the world of web development and
          explore new technologies and frameworks along the way. Feel free to
          connect with me if you share similar interests or have any questions.
          Let's learn and grow together!

        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>
          In terms of my future goals, I am incredibly passionate about web
          development and have a clear vision of where I want to go. One of my
          primary objectives is to create a personal project that holds great
          value to me – a blog app/website where individuals can share their
          thoughts, experiences, and ideas through engaging blog posts. I
          believe in the power of storytelling and how it can connect people
          from all walks of life. By developing this platform, I aim to foster a
          vibrant online community where individuals can express themselves and
          engage in meaningful discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I have set my sights on working at a big tech company,
          where I can leverage my web development skills and collaborate with
          like-minded professionals. Being part of a renowned tech company will
          provide me with valuable opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute
          to innovative projects that have a significant impact on the digital
          landscape. I am eager to immerse myself in a dynamic work environment,
          surrounded by talented individuals who share my passion for pushing
          the boundaries of technology.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h4>Login Signup Form</h4>
        <p>
          I created a responsive login form and signup form that provide a
          seamless user experience. The forms incorporate modern design
          principles and validation techniques to ensure data integrity. You can
          check out the project live at
          <a href="https://login-form-jarne.vercel.app/"

        <h4>Topsy Turvy Game</h4>
        <p>
          As a fan of game development, I ventured into creating a game using
          Pygame called 'Topsy Turvy.' Although it is not yet published, you can
          explore the project's source code on
          <a href="https://github.com/JarneDM/Topsy-Turvy">GitHub</a>. Topsy
          Turvy offers an engaging gaming experience with unique gameplay
          mechanics.
        </p>
        <h4>Google Clone (Design)</h4>
        <p>
          I undertook the challenge of recreating the design of Google's search
          engine. Although it does not have the full functionality, the clone
          demonstrates my attention to detail and ability to replicate complex
          interfaces. You can view the project live at
          <a href="https://google-clone-jarnedm.vercel.app/">Google Clone</a>
